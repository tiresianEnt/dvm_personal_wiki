Movement of water/liquids/substances across a [[Concentration Gradient\|Concentration Gradient]] of [[Solutes\|Solutes]]. The pattern is always from the area of higher concentration (imagine there's no space anymore, so they have to move) to the area of lower concentration.

The types of diffusion are:
[[Passive Diffusion\|Passive Diffusion]]
[[Facilitated Diffusion\|Facilitated Diffusion]]
[[Active Transport\|Active Transport]]
