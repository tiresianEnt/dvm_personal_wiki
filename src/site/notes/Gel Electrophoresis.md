Process that produces a readable pattern of [[DNA Fragments\|DNA Fragments]].
Place sample in wells in the gel tray fill with [[Agar Gel\|Agar Gel]] → Subject to electric current → DNA Fragments move
#### Application

[[Phosphate\|Phosphate]] groups provide the overall negative charge
DNA moves toward the positive pole.
The size of the fragments determine the rate of movement
DNA position stains the agar gel.
